## ðŸ“ª Where can I download Onix Client?

To download the Onix Client go to the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) channel. Once you do this you have a few options.

### Launcher (recommended option)
- Download the launcher and open it. Then, hit launch and in a few seconds it will be automatically injected into your game. Then, your done!

### Injector & DLL
- Use the Onix Injector and download the DLL. Select the DLL. Then, launch Minecraft and go back into the injector. Once, Minecraft loads click Inject.
- You can use a third-party injector but we cannot ensure that it will work properly and it is safe for public use.

## ðŸ”’ Is Onix Client safe?

Yes, we can assure that Onix Client is 100% safe for use. Your antivirus might flag it because it injects a DLL into the game. However, due note these things:
- Our injector can only inject into Minecraft, other viruses attack other applications, if not all.
- If you use any third-party program along with our DLL, we are **NOT** ensuring functionality or the fact that this is safe. However, any Onix Client file used is 100% safe.
- If you ever feel like anything is not safe, **DON'T** use it.

## ðŸ“± What devices does Onix Client support?

### You have to use Windows 10/11. You also need the 64-bit operating system with a x64-based processor.

- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Onix Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. We will not be showing you how to do that here, so go do your own research.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, ***x86***-based processor", unfortunately, you can't use Onix Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Onix Client either.

### We have no plan to support any other device other than Windows 10/11. Please do not ask, it is just annoying and people may be toxic to you.
